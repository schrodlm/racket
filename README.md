## Functional Programming

After a year of intesively increasing my knowledge of imperative languages. I decided it was time to take on some other **programming paradigms**. It was a really good choice,
it deepened my understanding how programming works and code in general. 

I have been getting to know theoretical model for functional programming - **Î»-calculus**. Racket is basically really close to this theoretical model with some additional functionality and syntax sugar.

In this repository I am trying to tackle some basic data structures and problems in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
